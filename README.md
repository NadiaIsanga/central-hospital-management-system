# 🏥 Centralized Hospital Management System for Chronic Illness Management

This project presents a SQL-based hospital management database system designed to improve care for chronic illnesses in Uganda. It consolidates patient records, appointments, emergency services, and public health reporting into a centralized platform to streamline hospital operations and decision-making.


## 📌 Summary

Designed and implemented a relational database for managing patient care, appointments, emergencies, and chronic illness reporting.  
Used MySQL Workbench for schema design and SQL for querying real-world healthcare insights.  
The system supports referral matching, ICU resource allocation, public health analytics, and appointment tracking.



## 🛠️ Skills Used

- **SQL**


## 🔍 Key Functional Queries

- **Detect frequent emergency patients:**  
  Identifies patients who accessed emergency services multiple times in one month.

- **Analyze disease burden by region:**  
  Aggregates public health data by disease and region to guide interventions.

- **Predict hospital resource needs:**  
  Estimates staffing and equipment demand from scheduled appointments.

- **Monitor ICU capacity:**  
  Lists hospitals with available ICU beds to manage emergency dispatches.

- **Identify patient follow-up gaps:**  
  Detects active chronic patients without upcoming appointments.



## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.sql` file in MySQL Workbench.
2. Run schema creation statements to build the database.
3. Populate sample data (already included).
4. Execute queries to generate insights for healthcare planning.
